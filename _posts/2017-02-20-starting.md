# The Starting Point

I'm starting this adventure with a background in software development with the only forms of artistic learning being in digital art classes for my general education.

I built my system in 2012. As nice as it would be to build a new system, it will challenge us on getting it to work with what we have and be forced to understand more of what we are doing and why we are choosing certain seetings.
